Compatibility testing - compatibility testing is an assessment to ensure a software is properly working across different browsers, versions, operating systems (OS), mobile devices, networks and hardware. 

Types of compatibility testing :-

Hardware testing - it checks software to be compatible with different hardware configurations. for example : ram, processor, har disk, ssd, graphic card.

Operating system testing - it checks your software to be compatible with different os like windows, unix,mac os etc.

software testing - It checks your developed software to be compatible with different software, for ex - ms word should be compatible with ms excel.

version testing -> it is for verifying your software application to be compatible with different versions

device testing - it checks the compatibility of your website/app with different devices.

network- evaluation of performance of a website in a network speed with varying parameters such as bandwith/speed.

cross browser- checking the web applications on multiple browsers.

Different Levels of Testing :-
Unit Testing.
Integration Testing.
System Testing.
Acceptance Testing.


unit testing -> unit testing is a method in which individual units of code gets tested.


integration testing- > two or more modules are integrated together and tested as a group.

Types of integration testing :-

1. big bang approach -> is an integration testin in which all the components/module/unit are being integrated together and at once tested as a whole application.

2. bottom up approach -> low level --- moderate level ----- high level 

3. top down approach -> high level --- moderate level ----- low level 


system testing-> is a type of testing in which we evaluate the overall functionality and performance of a complete software.


Alpha testing -> it is performed within the organization people or may be developers.

Beta testing -> It is performed by a selected group of friendly customers.

Acceptance testing-> software is tested for acceptability. the aim is to evaluate the system is working fine as per business requirements and judged whether it is acceptable for delivery or not.

Performance testing -to check whether the system meets the non functional requirements, examples of performance testing: stress, testing, volume testing, security, regression, mainitainance 

smoke testing - > is performed to verify the stability. we verify critical functionality.

Sanity testing- > we try to touch each implementation and its impact but not thoroughy or in depth and imay include functional, UI, version and so on.

Regression testing -> Regression is performed for passed test cases and new features added in the project.

Retesting ->   is performed for failed test cases, It is planned type of testing.


Ad-hoc testing - informal type of testing with aim to break the system , it is unplanned type of testing.

Monkey testing -> we aim to crash the application by providing some random inputs and check behavior of the application. this is also an unplanned type of testing.

Buddy testing -> unplanned testing, dev and tester will work together in order to develop and test the application at a rapid pace.

GUI Testing -> GUI testing involves the screens with the controls like buttons, icons, menus, hyperlinks, navbar and so on.

Exploratory Testing -> without any specific plans or schedules, Identifying the functionality by exploring the application, this contains min planning and max execution.
